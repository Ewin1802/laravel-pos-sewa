# Navigation Group Enum Implementation

## Issue

Filament resources were showing type errors because `$navigationGroup` property required type `string|UnitEnum|null` instead of just `string`.

## Solution

Created a UnitEnum for navigation groups to properly type the navigation groups in Filament resources.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Created NavigationGroup Enum

**File**: `app/Enums/NavigationGroup.php`

-   UnitEnum with 5 cases: Merchants, Subscriptions, Payments, Licenses, System
-   Added `getLabel()` method to return proper string labels

### 2. Updated All Filament Resources

Updated all resource files to use the NavigationGroup enum:

-   `app/Filament/Resources/Devices/DeviceResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/Merchants/MerchantResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/Plans/PlanResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/Subscriptions/SubscriptionResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/Invoices/InvoiceResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/Payments/PaymentResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/LicenseTokens/LicenseTokenResource.php`
-   `app/Filament/Resources/AuditLogs/AuditLogResource.php`

Changes made to each resource:

1. Added `use App\Enums\NavigationGroup;` import
2. Added `use UnitEnum;` import
3. Changed property declaration from:
    ```php
    protected static ?string $navigationGroup = 'GroupName';
    ```
    to:
    ```php
    protected static string|UnitEnum|null $navigationGroup = NavigationGroup::GroupName;
    ```

### 3. Updated AdminPanelProvider

**File**: `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`

-   Added NavigationGroup import
-   Updated navigationGroups configuration to use enum labels

## Navigation Groups Structure

-   **Merchants**: Merchants, Devices
-   **Subscriptions**: Plans, Subscriptions
-   **Payments**: Invoices, Payment Confirmations, Payments
-   **Licenses**: License Tokens
-   **System**: Audit Logs

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper type checking for navigation groups
2. ✅ **No More Errors**: All red errors in Filament resources are resolved
3. ✅ **Consistency**: Centralized navigation group definitions
4. ✅ **Maintainability**: Easy to modify navigation groups in one place
5. ✅ **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and refactoring support

## Testing

All Filament resources now load without type errors and navigation groups are properly organized in the admin panel.
